echo "üìã Test Cases Created:"
echo "  1. test-sync-1.json - Original data (3 users)"
echo "  2. test-sync-2.json - Modified data (4 users, added/changed fields)"
echo ""

echo "üîç Key Test Scenarios:"
echo "  - User #1: Email change (alice@example.com ‚Üí alice.johnson@example.com)"
echo "  - User #1: Age change (28 ‚Üí 29)"
echo "  - User #1: Added lastLogin field"
echo "  - User #1: Added language preference"
echo "  - User #2: Location change (Los Angeles ‚Üí San Francisco)"
echo "  - User #3: Removed (Charlie Brown)"
echo "  - User #4: Added (Diana Prince)"
echo "  - User #5: Added (Eve Wilson)"
echo "  - Metadata: Version bump (1.0 ‚Üí 2.0)"
echo "  - Metadata: Added updated field"
echo "  - Settings: API endpoint change (v1 ‚Üí v2)"
echo "  - Settings: Timeout change (5000 ‚Üí 8000)"
echo "  - Settings: Added realtime feature"
echo "  - System: Completely new section"
echo ""

echo "üéØ How to Test:"
echo "  1. Open http://localhost:5173"
echo "  2. Load test-sync-1.json in left viewer"
echo "  3. Load test-sync-2.json in right viewer"
echo "  4. Click on various diff items in the Differences panel"
echo "  5. Verify that both viewers scroll and align vertically"
echo "  6. Test both added nodes (should proportionally position) and changed nodes"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Expected Behavior:"
echo "  - Smooth 300ms animated scroll transitions"
echo "  - Target nodes aligned at 1/3 position from viewport top"
echo "  - Flash highlighting on target elements"
echo "  - Proportional positioning when node exists in only one viewer"
echo "  - No scroll oscillation or jumping"
echo ""

echo "üìä Debug Info:"
echo "  - Check browser console for detailed alignment logs"
echo "  - Look for '[calculateVerticalAlignment]' and '[JsonViewerSyncContext goToDiff]' messages"
echo "  - Verify element finding success/failure messages"
