# Save Server Integration Complete

## What Changed

The file save functionality has been successfully integrated into the Vite dev server using a custom Vite plugin. This eliminates the need to run a separate Express server.

### Before (Separate Server)
- Main app: `npm run dev` (Vite on port 5173)
- Save server: `npm run save-server` (Express on port 3001)
- Required running two separate processes

### After (Integrated)
- Everything: `npm run dev` (Vite with integrated save API)
- Save API available at the same origin as the main app
- Single process, simplified development

## Technical Details

### Changes Made

1. **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)**
   - Added custom `jsonSavePlugin()` that handles POST requests to `/api/save-samples`
   - Implements the same file saving logic as the original Express server
   - Uses Vite's built-in middleware system

2. **Frontend (`src/App.tsx`)**
   - Changed fetch URL from `http://localhost:3001/api/save-samples` to `/api/save-samples`
   - Now uses relative URL, automatically targeting the same origin

3. **Dependencies (`package.json`)**
   - Removed `express` and `cors` dependencies (no longer needed)
   - Removed `save-server` script
   - Simplified to just React dependencies

4. **File Management**
   - Old `save-server.js` moved to `save-server.js.backup` for reference
   - Same save functionality preserved with proper filename handling

### Benefits

1. **Simplified Development**
   - Only one command needed: `npm run dev`
   - No port conflicts or CORS issues
   - Unified development experience

2. **Better Integration**
   - Save API runs in the same process as the main app
   - Automatic hot reload includes API changes
   - Consistent error handling and logging

3. **Production Ready**
   - API can be easily deployed alongside the static assets
   - No need for separate backend infrastructure for file saves
   - Works seamlessly with Vite's build and preview modes

### File Save Behavior (Unchanged)

- Saves files to `/public` directory with actual filenames
- Ensures `.json` extension is present
- Pretty-prints JSON with 2-space indentation
- Returns success/error responses with file lists

## Usage

```bash
# Start development server (includes save API)
npm run dev

# The save functionality is automatically available at:
# http://localhost:5173/api/save-samples
```

The user experience remains exactly the same - the "Save Files" button in the UI works identically, but now everything runs through a single server process.
