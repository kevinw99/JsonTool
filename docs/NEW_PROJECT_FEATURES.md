## 🚀 **CURRENT TECHNICAL DEBT & ISSUES**

### **Known Problems to Fix in New Project**
- ❌ **Indentation alignment issues** - inconsistent visual spacing
- ❌ **CSS conflicts** - competing margin/padding rules
- ❌ **Expander positioning** - overlapping controls
- ❌ **Font dependency** - `ch` units cause inconsistencies
- ❌ **Closing bracket alignment** - not matching parent levels
- ❌ **Performance** - potential re-render issues with large JSONs

### **Architectural Improvements Needed**
- 🔧 **Clean CSS architecture** - no !important overrides
- 🔧 **Consistent spacing system** - pixel-based measurements
- 🔧 **Better component separation** - smaller, focused components
- 🔧 **Improved state management** - reduce prop drilling
- 🔧 **Better error handling** - graceful degradation
- 🔧 **Accessibility** - keyboard navigation, screen readers

## 📝 **NOTES FOR NEW IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **Start with pixel-based indentation** - avoid `ch` units entirely
2. **Use CSS Grid/Flexbox** - for robust layouts
3. **Implement proper TypeScript** - strict types from day one
4. **Design component hierarchy** - before writing code
5. **Write tests early** - prevent regression issues
6. **Use modern CSS** - CSS custom properties, logical properties
7. **Plan for performance** - virtual scrolling, memoization

### **Lessons Learned**
- Large monolithic commits make debugging difficult
- CSS !important creates maintenance nightmares  
- Font-dependent measurements cause cross-browser issues
- Complex state management needs careful planning
- User feedback is crucial for interaction design
