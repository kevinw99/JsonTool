Text mode:
  line #
  show json-path from root

2.ignore by value:
    a. numberic, by percentage
    b. string: by pattern, or one to one mapping
3. multi-selection : shift+click, ctrl+click
  a. for ignore
  b. for copy/paste
  c. for delete

3. group differnece panel
    a. by last field
    b. by type: differnt, new, delete
4 other forms:
  as a chrome plugin
  as a intellij plugin

can we  " ensure numeric paths are always  associated with viewers." by making a type to either force a  │
│   numbericPath always have a viewer/panel attribute, or create a new type, then force attribute not        │
│   null?

can you check all methods input and return have strict type on either viewerPath or IdBasedPath?         │
│   NumericPath or string can not be in input or return


can you update the place (like tests and other) use DiffResult.idKeyPath to use the new type?

let's fix some UI issues: 1. can you move the ending braket ] and } to align vertically with the matching starting
one?  it is still not fixed!

let's work on the text mode. When I clcik 'View as Text', it shows the text correctly. however, when I click back
to "View as Tree", it does not go back to tree mode.  can you fix that?.

That is good handling. however it is misleading to highlight the non-exist node in the other panel. can you do everything
except highlight it? so it is a special case. try to use existing code as much as possible and add an option not to
 hightlight non-exist node.


I see some inconsistency in whether { start a new line or not. e.g., in "parameters: {", { does not start a new line, while in
most other places, { starts a new line.
