Text mode: view only, no editing

  1 show line #
  2 show json-path from root to current node
 3. proper coloring for key and value.apply typical json editor coloring scheme

5 general json viewer feature
find/select/copy




2.ignore by value:
    a. numberic, by percentage
    b. string: by pattern, or one to one mapping
3. multi-selection : shift+click, ctrl+click

3. group differnece panel
    a. by last field
    b. go to button handling.

    b. by type: differnt, new, delete

 4. Idkey panel,
    consolidate similar one, how to go to each?

UI:
fully expand a node
fully collapse a node
expand/collapse all nodes at the same level, while keeping other levels unchanged




4 other forms:
  as a chrome plugin
  as a intellij plugin

can we  " ensure numeric paths are always  associated with viewers." by making a type to either force a  │
│   numbericPath always have a viewer/panel attribute, or create a new type, then force attribute not        │
│   null?

can you check all methods input and return have strict type on either viewerPath or IdBasedPath?         │
│   NumericPath or string can not be in input or return


can you update the place (like tests and other) use DiffResult.idKeyPath to use the new type?

let's fix some UI issues: 1. can you move the ending braket ] and } to align vertically with the matching starting
one?  it is still not fixed!

let's work on the text mode.
can you review the new files added for text mode, and see if any codes can be cleaned up or improved?




why we have both files :jsonCompare_clean.ts
                        jsonCompare.ts, which one is used? can we remove one?
let's add a new feature:
  2 show json-path from root to current node
  this should apply to both text mode and tree mode. a exmaple is shown in the attached screenshot. see the path
  level area still maintain the correct line #. and each path segment is clickable, clicking on it will move to the
   real node in the tree/text view.
