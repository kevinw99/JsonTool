2.ignore by value:
    a. numberic, by percentage
    b. string: by pattern, or one to one mapping
3. group differnece panel
    a. by last field
    b. by type: differnt, new, delete
4 other forms:
  as a chrome plugin
  as a intellij plugin

can we  " ensure numeric paths are always  associated with viewers." by making a type to either force a  │
│   numbericPath always have a viewer/panel attribute, or create a new type, then force attribute not        │
│   null?

can you check all methods input and return have strict type on either viewerPath or IdBasedPath?         │
│   NumericPath or string can not be in input or return

can you create test case for GotoDiff for Diff #2,  #7?
can you create test case for syncToCounterpart for Diff #1 #2,  #7? starting from the node on the left?

Actually this is a different type of path : boomerForecastV3Requests.parameters.accountParams.contributions[], it
is used to denote an array of objects, which is the key for DiffResult. however I think it should be
boomerForecastV3Requests[].parameters.accountParams[].contributions[].contributions[], with [] meaning an array of
objects, and the last array is the target array  the ID key used for comparison. We also have to assume that all
path matched boomerForecastV3Requests[].parameters.accountParams[].contributions[].contributions[], share the same
ID key for comparison. what do you think? if you agree,
 can you create a new type for this?

what is the handler name for clicking on the IDkeys entry? when this is clicked , "boomerForecastV3Requests[].parameters.accountParams[].contributions[].contributions[]"
what nodes should be highlighted on the left and right?

can you update the place (like tests and other) use DiffResult.idKeyPath to use the new type?
