Text mode: view only, no editing

  1 show line #
  2 show json-path from root to current node
 3. proper coloring for key and value.apply typical json editor coloring scheme

5 general json viewer feature
find/select/copy




2.ignore by value:
    a. numberic, by percentage
    b. string: by pattern, or one to one mapping
3. multi-selection : shift+click, ctrl+click
  a. for ignore
  b. for copy/paste
  c. for delete

3. group differnece panel
    a. by last field
    b. go to button handling.

    b. by type: differnt, new, delete

 4. Idkey panel,
    consolidate similar one, how to go to each?

UI:
fully expand a node
fully collapse a node
expand/collapse all nodes at the same level, while keeping other levels unchanged

what to do if json parse fails?


4 other forms:
  as a chrome plugin
  as a intellij plugin


let's fix some UI issues: 1. can you move the ending braket ] and } to align vertically with the matching starting
one?  it is still not fixed!

let's work on the text mode.
can you review the new files added for text mode, and see if any codes can be cleaned up or improved?




let's add a new feature:
  - show json-path from root to current node
  this should apply to both text mode and tree mode. a exmaple is shown in the attached screenshot. see the path
  level area still maintain the correct line #. and each path segment is clickable, clicking on it will move to the
   real node in the tree/text view.

actually this requirement might not be correct "see the path level area still maintain the correct line #"
let's work on the tree mode. Add context menu to
fully expand/collapse a node

expand/collapse all nodes(sibling) at the under different paraent, while keeping other levels unchanged


currently you implement it as hover, but it is not correct. It should only show when a node is selected. and the
breadcrumb should stay, does not change when mouse move away, and allow user to click on it to go to the node..

also it should appear as multiple lines for each segment, just like the screenshot I provided.

1. should be multi-line, each segment in one line
2. show the segment as exactly as it would be shown in the tree mode, no need for index or id= or . Should also be
indented properly.
3 advance feature: only show the segment when it is out of view port,  no need to select a node to show.
4. So you maintain the json path to the current scope of the view port, it contains multiple segments, you only
show the segments that are out of view port. can you re-describe the requirement?




  Yes, you can safely remove jsonCompare_clean.ts. Here's the analysis:

  Currently Used: /src/utils/jsonCompare.ts
  - Uses modern idBasedPath property in DiffResult interface
  - All active imports point to this file

  Unused: /src/utils/jsonCompare_clean.ts
  - Contains outdated interface with displayPath and numericPath properties
  - No imports found in the codebase
  - Appears to be a legacy backup

can you create UI test cases on manual navigation, such as picking the longest Difflist path, then clicking on
nodes
to manually expand/collapse, and assert the the synchronized expand/collapse . Note the Difflist path could be
idPath so it might need to be converted to a numeric path.
Also pick a node that could be outside of viewport, manually scroll on the left, and assert the sync scrolling
works correctly.

Can you add UI test cases to test synctocounterpart?, this can be add-on from the manual navigation test case. once
 you expand a node, you can click on the synctocounterpart button to see if the right side is expand and scrolled
 to
  the viewport. You can also click on the synctocounterpart button on the right side to see if the left side is.
