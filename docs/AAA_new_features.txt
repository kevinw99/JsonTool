4 other forms:

  as a intellij plugin

can we  " ensure numeric paths are always  associated with viewers." by making a type to either force a  │
│   numbericPath always have a viewer/panel attribute, or create a new type, then force attribute not        │
│   null?

can you check all methods input and return have strict type on either viewerPath or IdBasedPath?         │
│   NumericPath or string can not be in input or return


can you update the place (like tests and other) use DiffResult.idKeyPath to use the new type?

let's fix some UI issues: 1. can you move the ending braket ] and } to align vertically with the matching starting
one? 2. can you list the highlighing color scheme for different types of changes? I like to make them more subtle
and modern.

you introduce the vertical line to indicate changed parent, that is good! 1. we don't need vertical line for the
leaf node, it is only for parent node. 2. the change type new should still have green background. right now it is
subtle yellow background. 3. the bracket alignment is still not correct, can you fix it?
