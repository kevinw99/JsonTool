  "request": "Implement robust ignore diff functionality with pattern-based filtering\n\n- Add right-click context menu to ignore/unignore specific diffs\n- Implement pattern-based ignore system that creates {path}* patterns\n- Add ViewControls panel to display and manage ignored diffs with count and unignore buttons\n- Update IgnoredPanel to show both explicitly ignored diffs and manual patterns\n- Fix bottom tab ignored count to reflect total ignored items\n- Remove debug overlay from top-right corner showing ID Keys info\n- Integrate ignore functionality with existing DiffList filtering and visual highlighting\n- Ensure ignored diffs disappear from diff list and lose visual highlighting\n- Add proper state synchronization across all components\n- Support unignoring from both ViewControls and IgnoredPanel with âœ• buttons\n- Add 'Clear All' functionality to remove all ignored patterns\n\nKey changes:\n- JsonTreeView: Add context menu with ignore/unignore actions using addIgnoredPatternFromRightClick()\n- JsonViewerSyncContext: Add pattern-based ignore system with proper memoization and dependencies\n- ViewControls: Show ignored diff count and management UI for right-click ignored items\n- IgnoredPanel: Separate display of ignored diffs vs manual patterns with proper unignore actions\n- TabbedBottomPanel: Update ignored count calculation to include all pattern types\n- DiffList: Use existing pattern-based filtering for proper diff hiding\n- App.tsx: Remove persistent debug overlay\n\nThe ignore system now works exactly like manually adding patterns - ignoring 'legacyContributionsFlowsRequestsResponses' creates pattern 'legacyContributionsFlowsRequestsResponses*' which filters all matching diffs and removes visual highlighting.
