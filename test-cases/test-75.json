  "request": "implement sequential array expansion for deep navigation\n\nInstead of trying to expand just the immediate parent, this approach:\n1. Identifies ALL array containers in the path that need expansion\n2. Expands them sequentially with proper delays\n3. Ensures each level is fully expanded before moving to the next\n\nFor path 'root.accountParams[1].contributions[0].contributionType':\n- Step 1: Expand 'root.accountParams'\n- Step 2: Expand 'root.accountParams[1].contributions'\n- Step 3: Highlight final target\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (diff panel)",
