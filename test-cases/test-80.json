  "request": "improve GoTo functionality for ID-based paths\n\nKey changes:\n- Update goToDiff to handle both numeric and ID-based paths by converting ID-based paths to numeric using convertIdPathToIndexPath\n- Simplify DiffList navigation to use standard goToDiff approach instead of complex manual highlighting\n- Fix remaining numericPath references to use idBasedPath after DiffResult refactoring\n\nThis should resolve the issue where clicking Go To on diffs wasn't expanding to show the target nodes.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (diff panel)",
