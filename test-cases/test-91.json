  "request": "prevent misleading highlights for asymmetric diffs\n\n## Problem\nWhen navigating to asymmetric diffs (e.g., nodes that exist in only one panel),\nthe system would highlight both panels even when the target node didn't exist\nin one of them. This was misleading for users.\n\n## Solution\nAdded optional highlighting parameters to goToDiffWithPaths():\n- highlightLeft?: boolean (default: true)\n- highlightRight?: boolean (default: true)\n\n## Implementation\n- Updated goToDiffWithPaths() to conditionally highlight based on flags\n- Modified goToDiff() to pass appropriate highlighting flags:\n  * Both paths exist: highlight both panels\n  * Left-only path: highlight only left panel\n  * Right-only path: highlight only right panel\n- Preserved all existing navigation, expansion, and scrolling behavior\n\n## Benefits\n- No misleading highlights for non-existent nodes\n- Clear visual feedback for asymmetric diffs\n- Backward compatible with existing calls\n- Uses existing code without duplication\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
