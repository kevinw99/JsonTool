  "request": "improve goto navigation by expanding parent arrays first\n\n- Add getParentArrayPath helper to identify parent arrays that need expansion\n- Implement staged expansion: parent array first, then target element\n- Add timing delays to ensure each expansion completes before the next\n- This should fix the 'Target not found' issue for deeply nested elements\n\nThe navigation now follows: Parent Array → Target Element → Highlight\ninstead of trying to navigate directly to deeply nested targets.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (diff panel)",
