  "request": "add line numbers to tree mode\n\nAdded a line number gutter to the left side of the JSON tree view:\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Created line-numbers-gutter component with proper styling\n- Line numbers update dynamically based on visible nodes using MutationObserver\n- Numbers reflect actual rendered lines, not JSON structure\n- Consistent styling with text mode (gray background, right-aligned)\n\n**Layout**:\n- Flex layout with fixed-width gutter (50px) and flexible tree content\n- Line numbers are non-selectable and properly aligned\n- Matches text editor line numbering behavior\n\n**Technical Details**:\n- Uses querySelectorAll('.json-node') to count visible lines\n- MutationObserver tracks DOM changes for real-time updates\n- Clean separation between line numbers and tree content\n- Fixed TypeScript errors related to idBasedPath vs numericPath\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (JSON tree navigation, styling)",
