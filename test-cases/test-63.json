  "request": "implement ID-based correlation for Go To button in diff panel\n\n- Add smart correlation logic that finds corresponding elements by ID instead of position\n- DiffList now receives both left and right JSON data for correlation analysis\n- Parse display paths with ID-based arrays [id=value] to find numeric positions in each viewer\n- Implement dual highlighting that shows correct corresponding elements even when at different array indices\n- Fix issue where difference #8 was highlighting wrong element in right viewer\n- Use manual DOM highlighting to avoid overwriting when paths differ between viewers\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (diff panel, main app)",
