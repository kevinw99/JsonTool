  "request": "resolve text-to-tree mode switching and improve bracket alignment\n\n## Text Mode Switching Fix\n- Fixed handleViewModeToggle() to properly parse JSON string back to object when switching from text to tree mode\n- Issue: switching back to tree mode showed corrupted text instead of tree structure\n- Solution: use JSON.parse() when switching from text mode (newIsTextMode = false)\n\n## Bracket Alignment Improvements\n- Created separate CSS variable --closing-bracket-indent for fine-tuned bracket alignment\n- Moved bracket positioning logic from JavaScript to CSS using custom properties\n- Opening brackets remain unchanged, only closing bracket positioning is adjustable\n- Single source of truth for all spacing values in CSS variables\n\n## CSS Organization\n- Added bracket alignment system with dedicated CSS section\n- Used CSS calc() for dynamic padding based on nesting level\n- Cleaner separation between opening and closing bracket positioning logic\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (JSON tree navigation, styling, main app)",
