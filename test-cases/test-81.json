  "request": "GoTo expansion now uses correct viewer-prefixed paths\n\nThe issue was that expandedPaths state uses viewer-prefixed paths like 'viewer1_root'\nbut goToDiff was adding paths without these prefixes. This caused the expansion to fail.\n\nChanges:\n- Add viewer1_ and viewer2_ prefixes when adding paths to expandedPaths\n- Update selectors to check data-original-path attribute with viewer prefixes\n- Add both viewer paths for synchronized expansion\n\nThis should fix the GoTo button not expanding nodes properly.",
