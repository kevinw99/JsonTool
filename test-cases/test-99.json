  "request": "eliminate nested scrollable containers for robust scroll synchronization\n\n## Problem\n- Scroll synchronization was not working due to nested scrollable containers\n- Outer SyncScroll wrapper and inner .json-tree-content both had overflow:auto\n- Users scrolled inner container but sync listened to outer container\n\n## Solution\n- Move SyncScroll inside JsonTreeView to wrap only actual scrollable content\n- Eliminate outer SyncScroll wrappers from App.tsx\n- Change sync group from \"json-viewers\" to \"json-tree-content\"\n- Keep breadcrumb as fixed header outside scrollable area\n\n## Architecture Changes\n- Before: SyncScroll (outer) <- listening / .json-tree-content <- scrolling\n- After: Breadcrumb (fixed) / SyncScroll (.json-tree-content) <- both\n\n## Key Benefits\n- Single scrollable container per viewer eliminates conflicts\n- Direct targeting matches user interaction with synchronization\n- Consistent with previous .json-tree-content targeting fixes\n- Clean separation of fixed UI vs scrollable content\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (JSON tree navigation, main app)",
