  "request": "resolve synchronize scrolling issues with clean SyncScroll implementation\n\n## Problem\n- Synchronize scrolling was not working between left and right JSON viewers\n- Complex custom sync implementation was causing conflicts and failures\n- goToDiff navigation could expand nodes but wouldn't scroll to target elements\n\n## Solution\n- Replaced complex custom sync handler with clean SyncScroll component\n- Fixed goToDiff to target correct scrollable containers (.json-tree-content)\n- Added proper CSS class names for scroll container identification\n- Implemented temporary sync disabling during programmatic scrolling\n- Refactored duplicate scroll logic into reusable helper function\n\n## Key Changes\n- App.tsx: Replaced custom sync implementation with SyncScroll components\n- SyncScroll.tsx: Cleaned up debug logging, simplified scroll handling\n- JsonViewerSyncContext.tsx: Fixed container targeting and refactored scroll logic\n- Added comprehensive test cases for goToDiff functionality\n\n## Technical Details\n- Uses .json-tree-content as the actual scrollable container\n- Temporary sync disabling prevents interference during programmatic navigation\n- Proper dependency ordering fixes initialization issues\n- Clean separation of concerns between sync and navigation logic\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> (main app)",
